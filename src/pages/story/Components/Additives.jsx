            We are Yorkshire’s premium Tequila connoisseurs with a passion for
            authentic tequila and the Canadian Sphynx. This has led us to
            creating SPHYNX Tequila®, the first female-led British tequila
            brand, with the rich history of Mexico at the heart of it.

        We wanted to take you back to the authentic ways of enjoying Tequila,
        this required a decade of travelling to Mexico, tasting and
        understanding the complex and unique ways of creating a tequila so
        smooth that you wouldn't want to mix it with anything but exquisite
        company. As you raise your glass with SPHYNX Tequila® you will naturally
        be raising the bar.
      </p>

        Handcrafted artisan Tequila, created from classic and modern distilling
        methods, we deliver to you the smoothest, cleanest Tequila range. A
        balance of power and perfection, with the added magic of a Sphynx.

        “We finished late one evening, tasting our custom made tequila profiles
        for our range, knowing full well that we had a very early morning to
        follow. When we woke up the next day at 5am bright eyed and bushy
        tailed, that was the moment we knew we’d not only found our distillery
        but our tequila too.” - Founders of SPHYNX Tequila®.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our distillery is truly the Queen Distiller of Jalisco, a family with
        several generations of expertise and acres of their own blue agave
        fields. They batch produce for SPHYNX Tequila® and truly understand that
        we are creating a renaissance for the way we drink tequila and we assure
        you that you will never drink tequila with salt and lime again.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have taken the finest agave, grown for a minimum age of seven years
        and put it through traditional methods. We chose to age our tequila in
        various French oak barrels that allowed us to create custom profiles
        just for SPHYNX Tequila® giving you a unique smooth flavour that allows
        you to pour it over ice, sip and enjoy.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was important that our finest tequila profiles reached you in our
        Iconic SPHYNX® decanter, which has taken nearly half a decade to
        achieve. We have worked with some of the most talented craftsmen & women
        in Mexico to perfect the design. Handcrafted from 100% recycled glass,
        we have created a timeless piece of art, as well as a conscious one. Our
        decanter represents good fortune and abundance like the Sphynx itself -
        a talking point for any soirée.
      </p>

      <p>
        SPHYNX Tequila®, born out of an unorthodox love story. Just like the
        Sphynx cat, our tequila represents extroverted behaviour, a high level
        of energy, intelligence, curiosity and affection for life itself. We
        look forward to you creating magical memories with SPHYNX Tequila®.{' '}
